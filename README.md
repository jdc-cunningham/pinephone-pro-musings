### About

Trying to use PinePhone Pro as a dev environment

### The setup

<img src="./setup2.JPG" width="800"/>

Keyboard is EPOMAKER EP84

The monitor is an HP Pavilion 21.5in IPS LED HDMI 1080P. It's a convenient design being a rectangle when viewed from the side.

The case I [designed](https://github.com/jdc-cunningham/crud-pinephone-app/blob/master/monitor-phone-as-webcam-stand/model-stl.stl), the Pinephone Pro just snaps right in, it's nice.

Listen to this [sound](https://youtu.be/oUS52Lfekdo?t=307).

### responsive design
