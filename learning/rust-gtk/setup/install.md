Have rust already, ran the commands for gtk debian

Doing this gtk4 crate dependencies

Damn this is taking a bit... fetching

Cutting it close, 20's battery percentage level, fetch at 85%

It's incrementing a tenth of a percent (download progress) per second is the thing ha

I think if I want to run this command

```
cargo add gtk4 --rename gtk --features v4_6
```

I'll need full battery, I'll try it after pushing lol
