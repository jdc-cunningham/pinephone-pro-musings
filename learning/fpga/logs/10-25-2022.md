Late start today but today's topic is FPGAs

Specifically I bought one, my first one ever, Orange Crab 25F

Ooh it's RISC-V interesting

What is this ECP5

Damn... so many acronyms

FPGA

emulate basic logic elements AND, OR, NOR, XOR

I designed an ALU a long time ago... in CSE-241 I don't know if it worked though because if I remember right everyone just got 100's or high scores...

flip-flops/registers... rising edge of a clock signal

This board can do something like a 32bit CPU @ 75MHz

This is definitely beyond my skills at this time, what the hell would I use this for.

I've just always thought FPGA's are cool as hell

This thing has a battery charger ha... it could be battery powered

At some point I want to mess around with satellite stuff like NOAA maybe FPGA could be useful then

Ooh this Linux on OrangeCrab looks interesting

I bought a bunch of little OLEDs and an E-paper, hardcore project would be a tiny cyberdeck ha.

Interesting about the USB based DFU bootloader.

I do want to learn/get exposed to Verilog/HDL those seem popular.

RISCV GCC looks interesting

I will read on this before I try anything with it but the Linux thing sounds interesting.

Will be cool to see your cliche terminal interface on a screen

OMG... the f*n interface of YouTube in Firefox is different, no volume, I can't seek video... lmao so annoying

watching https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=aSFoG59UkiU

VGA controller hmm, ooh control physical stuff, might understand PWA finally

Oh I'm on mobile youtube

I'll cap myself to an hour of these PPP sessions

Conway's game of life in FPGA hmm

soft-core processor

hmm FFT

Verilog is weakly typed, more like C, VHDL is opposite
