Late start today but today's topic is FPGAs

Specifically I bought one, my first one ever, Orange Crab 25F

Ooh it's RISC-V interesting

What is this ECP5

Damn... so many acronyms

FPGA

emulate basic logic elements AND, OR, NOR, XOR

I designed an ALU a long time ago... in CSE-241 I don't know if it worked though because if I remember right everyone just got 100's or high scores...

flip-flops/registers... rising edge of a clock signal

This board can do something like a 32bit CPU @ 75MHz

This is definitely beyond my skills at this time, what the hell would I use this for.

I've just always thought FPGA's are cool as hell

This thing has a battery charger ha... it could be battery powered

At some point I want to mess around with satellite stuff like NOAA maybe FPGA could be useful then

Ooh this Linux on OrangeCrab looks interesting

I bought a bunch of little OLEDs and an E-paper, hardcore project would be a tiny cyberdeck ha.

Interesting about the USB based DFU bootloader.

I do want to learn/get exposed to Verilog/HDL those seem popular.

RISCV GCC looks interesting

I will read on this before I try anything with it but the Linux thing sounds interesting.

Will be cool to see your cliche terminal interface on a screen
