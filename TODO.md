These are a list of things I can do while using a battery a day on this phone for a bit.

- finish NodeJS setup
  - downloaded binary, tried to set in profile
    not recognized for v16
- look up powered docks that will work
- maybe do C in 24 hours again just for practice
- maybe see if Tauri/rust will run on this
  - yes someone already did it
