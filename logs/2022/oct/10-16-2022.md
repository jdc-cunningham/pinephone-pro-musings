I realized I'm not always going to be developing

I started a stopwatch, going to see how many minutes.

I don't really want to do anything right now but I am staying true to using a battery's worth a day for a week or so

I'll be doing some self reflection today, calm the mind

I do feel spent

Yeah I'm just looking at random stuff today, not really trying to get anything done/learn anything

Opened tab 4 in firefox, tried to drag, crashed

I'm tempted to go through this C in 24 hours again... but why. Same for C++ like I know how to write these languages already... I don't know them front to back... what do I gain from looking at it again if it's not applied... deeper understanding maybe

Also the concern of not needing to write native, if say Tauri/Rust can write a linux app why not use that...

41 mins in went from 100% battery to 24%

Actually I do have ideas on what I can do

I can use this isolated environment (with reduced compute) and forced focus to learn

I can read stuff and take notes, mostly around getting better as a developer and writing lower-level software
