crap it's already at 23% battery life

10-15-2022 17:09 PM

Using Mobian Phosh on SD card now
Battery was fully charged but screwing around
Now at 92% connected to 1080P monitor, keyboard and mouse
Will see how this goes
Turned bluetooth off
Display settings apply button barely visible (blue) but could click
While phone is in landscape mode
Mouse can jump into different screens, nice
chromium-browser not on mobian
I'm using the phone as an app launcher
Small screen probably for terminal or watching resources
I'm using my non-battery powered keyboard thinking that'll make it last longer since not trying to charge onboard batter
There's no app launcher bar that's easy to get to
Portfolio is the file manager
Copy paste is supported
Debian/apt based is great, using dpkg to install deb files
What am I going to do with this phone?
Issues installing vscode


Trying to get node install to work, tried from binary
Trying powertop to see current draw

What's annoying is the screen settings don't stick
They change later on
Trying to get plasma on but no copy-paste between applications
