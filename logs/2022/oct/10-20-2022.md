late start today

connected to bluetooth speaker, going to try it out

sees the device, connects, but immediately disconnects, does not stay connected hmm

I'm kind of spent now... I was thinking I should learn GTK, not just rely on cross-platform browser wrappers.

I'm going to get a powered dock for this thing

I can't think of an app I want... I have apps I want but they're browser-based, not meant to be used on the PPP since the PPP is just a hobby device for me.

Just reading

At the end of the day, devices like this are important to offer more options (not just Apple or Android).
