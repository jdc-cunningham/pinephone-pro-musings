I'm doing some learning on another topic right now.

Side note the wallpaper looks great on the phone itself.

battery seems good when you're just using a couple fo browser tabs

still unpowered till the day I buy a powered dock

alright done with that reading, guess back to rust

interesting that the terminals eg. console in mobian have a maximum size (can't make it bigger)

I realize I need to actually work on something to really enforce learning attempts. Also nice to see tangible progress.

have to remember how to compile

damn has errors need to look at it else where
