Can't open VS code small... so I can't minimize it.

Keeps opening as full screen

I'll just continue learning Rust for now

Well at least I can bring Firefox to the foreground just not ideal

It's `fn + f3` on my keyboard

Okay long way to go about it but if VS Code is full screen, open a new window (probably opens smaller), close full screen window, open recent in smaller window. Avoid snapping (otherwise goes full screen)

Man I feel like shit right now, probably all the binge eating

setting wallpaper lol

nice works

well that was fun, died mid push even at "19%" battery...

resulted in bad head, corrupted object... had to remove git, re-init, add remote again, push separate branch, oh well

also brutal typing on a phone
