7:30 PM

feeling spent today, do have some projects in mind

can't do it now, unfortunately this environment is limiting mostly the screen real-estate

I like a side by side layout where I can see what I'm working on, on the right

a split 1080P panel is kinda small

god fresh account YT video recommendations is cancer

Yeah I'm just chilling right now, reading HN
